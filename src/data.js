module.exports = {
  render: `The render() method is the only required method in a class component.

  When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return one of the following types:
  
  * React elements. Typically created via JSX.
  * Arrays and fragments.
  * Portals. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree.
  * String and numbers. These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
  * Booleans or null. Render nothing.
  
  The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time itâ€™s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.
  
  If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount()`,
  defaultProps: `defaultProps can be defined as a property on the component class itself, to set the default props for the class. This is used for undefined props, but not for null props.`
